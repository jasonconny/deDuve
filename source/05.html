		<h1>The Invention of Non-Art: A History</h1>
		<h2>Thierry de Duve on the rise of the art-in-general system</h2>

		<div class="intro">
			<p><strong>In the fifth in a series</strong> of new essays on the avant-garde for <em>Artforum</em>, historian and philosopher Thierry de Duve investigates the ideas behind one of modernism's most notorious inventions: non-art, the vexing category of things that reject, trouble and ultimately expand the definistion of art itself. From the nineteenth-century Beaux-Arts systemt to Marcel Duchamp's radical readymade <em>Fountain</em>, 1917, to the pluralism of the present day; from the fin-de-siècle ruminations of Stéphane Mallarmé to the aesthetic pronouncements of Clement Greenberg, de Duve reveals the astonishing theoretical implications of non-art—as term, as idea, adn as type. In the process, he offers a groundbreaking narrative for the emergence of our contemporary understanding of art.</p>
